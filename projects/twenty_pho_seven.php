            Twenty Pho Seven is a business website that I made in my first year in BCIT. I decided to go with a Vietnamese restaurant because I initially came up with its name a long time ago and I thought that it would be fun if I call the restaurant "Twenty Pho Seven". My classmates then helped me with some logo designs and color palette for my website.

            This project is purely made from HTML and CSS with a little bit of scripting. Since I have not dealt with media queries, flexbox or bootstrap, this website is not responsive. For the development of this project, I gathered the pictures from Adobe Stock. I researched and refer to pre-existing Vietnamese restaurants regarding the look and feel of how an "authentic" Vietnamese restaurant would look like. For the menu, I just listed down all of the food that I had tried from all the Vietnamese restaurant around Vancouver. I played around with the word "PHO" and came up with "Pho U, Pho Me, Pho Us and Pho Them" (For you, For Me, For Us, For Them) as the labels to the menu.</p>

             Since this project is my first ever web application that I have to code from scratch, I had some ups and downs throughout the development of the project. I was too ambitious for the first project that I wanted it to look unique. For example, not many websites have a navigation bar on the side and that is the reason why I decided to have Twenty Pho Seven's navigation bar on the side. Some challenges that I had was the positioning, I had a little knowledge of media queries at that time and all of my assets are positioned as absolute so when you try to resize the browser, everything moves. Another thing is the logo, in all of the processes that I did before actually developing the app, I was using the original layout of the logo, although I was satisfied with my first logo design, our instructor suggested to change it into something simpler and cleaner since that is what the website it all about.
